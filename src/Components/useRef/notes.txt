UseREf:

The useRef hook in React is primarily used for accessing and interacting with a mutable object that 
persists across renders. Unlike state (managed by useState), changes to the ref object do not trigger 
a re-render of the component. It's often used for accessing and interacting with the DOM directly or
 for persisting values between renders.

 
 Remember that when using useRef, the component won't re-render when the current property is mutated. 
 If you need to trigger a re-render when the value changes, you should use state (useState). 
 useRef is especially useful for situations where you need to persist values across renders without
causing re-renders.
