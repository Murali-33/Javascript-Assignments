useReducer:

The useReducer hook is a React hook that is used for more complex state logic in functional components.
It is an alternative to useState and is particularly useful when the state transitions are complex and involve multiple actions.
The useReducer hook follows the same principles as the Redux library, which is a state management library commonly used with React.



reducer: A function that specifies how the state should be updated in response to different actions. It takes the current state and an action as arguments and returns the new state.

initialState: The initial state of the component.

state: The current state.

dispatch: A function that is used to dispatch actions to the reducer, triggering state updates.
